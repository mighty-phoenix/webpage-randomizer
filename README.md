# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

## What is it?

Using Cloudflare Workers, I deployed an application that randomly sends users to one of two webpage variants. This project taught me how to write applications with the Cloudflare Workers API, manage and develop them using the command-line tool Wrangler, and deploy them to the free workers.dev deployment playground.
